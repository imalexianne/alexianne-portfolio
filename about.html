            <p style=" padding-top: 20px; padding-bottom: 50px; padding-right: 80px" ><em style="font-family: 'Courgette', cursive;">I like software programming because it helps to build systems or products to overcome different social problems.From the time I was in campus, I’ve been interested in programming and I did computer engineering where I make different class projects using different languages and enjoyed it so much that I decided to join Moringa School where I spent 1200 hours over 6 months and my programming skills have been strengthened. I learnt HTML, CSS, and Javascript, how to fetch data from other application to be used and I specialized in Python. I get experienced in programming because there were more practices and many toy problems solving . I worked on the application of Neighborhood, a website application which help  users to be updated with their village’s current information. I integrated postgreSQL database, python using django framework. So at the end of Moringa school, I worked both as software engineer and scrum master on a team of 4 people to build an UpdateMe application for event organisers to more easily communicate with their clients (attendees) and facilitate the attendees to book for ticket by paying online before the event time and we integrated postgreSQL database, we used python language for the application functionality, HTML, CSS as well as deployment features for the application to be hosted.
